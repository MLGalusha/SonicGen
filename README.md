# SonicGen

SonicGen is a scalable audio deduplication and source identification engine.  
It takes an audio clip or YouTube video URL and determines where that sound originated by matching it against a growing database of indexed recordings.  

SonicGen works as a standalone product but also serves as the core deduplication system used by Truth Engine.
